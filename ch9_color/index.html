        Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley discovered plutonium in December 1940, though because of the war, they didn't announce their findings until 1948. During that gap, Levenson's X-10 plant in Oak Ridge was the first production reactor
        to make plutonium-239.

        Initial nuclear bomb designs used a gun-type method, slamming together two pieces of subcritical U-235 to create an explosion, though these were relatively unsafe and prone to accidental detonation. Implosion-type bombs came next, featuring a fissile
        core surrounded by an explosive lens that, when ignited, squeezed the core material into a supercritical mass. Implosion-type bombs gave scientists more control over detonation and allowed them to use plutonium as the fissile material.
